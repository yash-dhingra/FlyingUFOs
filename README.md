# FlyingUFOs
This is the first game I've ever built. There are a few bugs so it's just a prototype and will be fixed in Version-1.2.0

You might face some trouble starting the game(Cursor not visible) so ensure that your cursor is centered then click to open the game. If not then move your mouse around and wait for the button to slightly change it's color and then click to enter the game.

Note: Only Mac version of the Application supports Ray Tracing. Windows will soon support raytracing as well. 

Only one UFO spawn location is added as of now and and many more random location + speed variablitity will be added soon. 
As of now it supports only one graphic level ((Ultra HD) Frame issues on Slow Computers(Many to Come))

To Exit the Game just press Esc, Esc wont work on menu.
